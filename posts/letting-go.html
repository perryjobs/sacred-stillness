    <p>Letting go is one of the hardest things we do. But it’s also one of the holiest.</p>
    <p>Prayer invites us to hand over what we were never meant to carry alone—fear, control, grief, guilt. The act of surrender is an act of trust.</p>
    <blockquote class="italic border-l-4 pl-4 text-green-800 border-green-400">
      “Cast your cares on the Lord and He will sustain you.” — Psalm 55:22
    </blockquote>
    <p>In your next quiet moment, pray simply: “God, I release what is not mine to hold. Fill me with peace in its place.”</p>
    <p>You were never meant to carry it all. And you don’t have to.</p>
