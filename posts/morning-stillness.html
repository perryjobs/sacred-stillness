    <p>Each morning offers us a quiet invitation: to breathe, to listen, and to be present before the noise of the world begins.</p>

    <p>Practicing stillness in the morning is not about doing more—it's about allowing space for peace to rise within you. As the sun gently rises, so too can your awareness of the sacred within and around you.</p>

    <blockquote class="italic border-l-4 pl-4 text-green-800 border-green-400">
      “In the morning, O Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation.” — Psalm 5:3
    </blockquote>

    <p>Try this: before you reach for your phone, sit by a window, breathe deeply, and offer a short prayer of gratitude. These sacred moments will ground your spirit and shape your day.</p>

    <p>Stillness isn't emptiness—it’s fullness in disguise.</p>
