    <p>In the chaos of modern life, our breath is always with us—quiet, faithful, present.</p>
    <p>God created us with breath as the first sign of life. In spiritual practice, breathing slowly and intentionally brings us back to center, back to the present moment where God is waiting.</p>
    <blockquote class="italic border-l-4 pl-4 text-green-800 border-green-400">
      “The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.” — Job 33:4
    </blockquote>
    <p>Try this: Sit quietly. Inhale slowly for 4 seconds. Hold for 4. Exhale for 4. Repeat three times. As you breathe, whisper: “Peace in. Worry out.”</p>
    <p>Your breath is not just physical—it’s sacred. Let it anchor you to stillness.</p>
